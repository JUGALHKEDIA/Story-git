chapter 5;
so here is what I learned how to create a github repo.
sign-in to github.com account,
on to top right corner click "+" icon,
Name you github repo,
add an optional message,
no need to create read.me file in advance(you can add it later),
check private/public accordingly.
hit create.
once done you are provided with a link to his repo.
now you can push your local git repo to this newly create github repo
use this following command;
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new_repo
git push origin master
